    <h2>AGREEMENT TO MY LEGAL TERMS</h2>
    <p>I am Stephan Santos ("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>I</strong>", "<strong>my</strong>", "<strong>me</strong>"), an individual residing in Washington, United States.</p>
    <p>I operate the website <a href="https://okay.stephansantos.com">https://okay.stephansantos.com</a> (the "<strong>Site</strong>") as well as any other related products and services that refer or link to these legal terms (the "<strong>Legal Terms</strong>") (collectively, the "<strong>Services</strong>").</p>
    <p>You can contact me by email at stephanforapps@gmail.com.</p>
    <p>These Legal Terms constitute a legally binding agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity ("<strong>you</strong>"), and Stephan Santos, concerning your access to and use of the Services.

By granting my access to any Third-Party Accounts, you understand that (1) I may access, make available, and store (if applicable) any content that you have provided to and stored in your Third-Party Account (the "Social Network Content") so that it is available on and through the Services via your account, including without limitation any friend lists and (2) I may submit to and receive from your Third-Party Account additional information to the extent you are notified when you link your account with the Third-Party Account.

PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR THIRD-PARTY ACCOUNTS IS GOVERNED SOLELY BY YOUR AGREEMENT(S) WITH SUCH THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

    <h2>10. PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
    <p>I care about data privacy and security. Please review my Privacy Policy: <a href="http://okay.stephansantos.com/privacy" target="_blank">http://okay.stephansantos.com/privacy</a>. By using the Services, you agree to be bound by my Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Legal Terms. Please be advised the Services are hosted in the United States. If you access the Services from any other region of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable laws in the United States, then through your continued use of the Services, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed in the United States.</p>
    <h2>11. TERM AND TERMINATION</h2>
    <p>These Legal Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE LEGAL TERMS, I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN MY SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE LEGAL TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. I MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICES OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT WARNING, IN MY SOLE DISCRETION.</p>
    <p>If I terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, I reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.</p>
    <h2>12. MODIFICATIONS AND INTERRUPTIONS</h2>
    <p>I reserve the right to change, modify, or remove the contents of the Services at any time or for any reason at my sole discretion without notice. However, I have no obligation to update any information on my Services. I will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, price change, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.</p>
    <p>I cannot guarantee the Services will be available at all times. I may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Services, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. I reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Services at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that I have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Services during any downtime or discontinuance of the Services. Nothing in these Legal Terms will be construed to obligate me to maintain and support the Services or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith.</p>
    <h2>13. GOVERNING LAW</h2>
    <p>These Legal Terms and your use of the Services are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington applicable to agreements made and to be entirely performed within the State of Washington, without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>
    <h2>14. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
    <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>
    <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or me (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
    <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>
    <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website <a href="www.adr.org" target="_blank">www.adr.org</a>. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in King County, Washington. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>
    <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in King County, Washington, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Legal Terms.</p>
    <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one (1) years after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
    <h3>Restrictions</h3>
    <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually.
